# Accident Report Analysis 2021 vs 2022

---
## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident casualties across the years 2021 and 2022. The purpose of this analysis is to understand trends, identify high-risk factors, and highlight key insights using visualizations. The dashboard supports data-driven decisions by providing filters for accident date and location.

## Key Performance Indicators
1. Total casualties - This metric provides a quick glance at the overall severity of road accidents.
2. Casualties by Accident Severity and Vehicle Type - Identifies the most dangerous vehicle types and the impact of severity levels on casualty count.
3. Casualties by Vehicle Type - It is showing casualties split by different vehicle types. Cars are observed as the most casualty-prone vehicle, indicating a need for stricter driver behavior monitoring and enforcement.
4. Monthly Trend (Line Chart) - Line chart comparing month-wise casualties for 2021 and 2022.
5. Casualties by Road Type (Bar Chart) -  Identifies roads with higher risk and helps urban planners focus on safer infrastructure design.
6. Casualties by Road Surface (Treemap) - Treemap offers a compact way to highlight road conditions that lead to more casualties.
7. Casualties by Location (Donut Chart) - onut chart showing regional/city-wise breakdown
8. Casualties by Light Condition (Donut Chart) - Highlights time-of-day risk patterns.
## Filter Pane
Accident Date: Allows users to select specific time periods for analysis.

Location: Helps zoom into specific cities or regions for focused insights.

## Key recommendations
1. Increase safety awareness for car drivers, especially during peak months.

2. Improve lighting and road signage in accident-prone areas.

3. Focus infrastructure investments on high-casualty road types.

4. Conduct regular maintenance to reduce accidents on uneven road surfaces.

5. Enhance enforcement in regions and times with high accident frequency.

## Conclusion
The dashboard provides a multi-dimensional view of accident casualties for 2021 vs 2022. By examining severity, vehicle type, environmental conditions, and temporal patterns, stakeholders can prioritize interventions for improving road safety.
